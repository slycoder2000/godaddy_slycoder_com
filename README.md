## Task

Overview of workhistory, online resume and portfolio.
Also has sandboxes and subdomains for potential clients.

## Criteria

- PHP used for DRY programming for libraries, headers and footers
- Bootstrap for basic cosmetics

## Summary of Tech Stack 
This app was built on godaddy, mainly because I've had the domain and hosting setup for years with .NET functionality.  

## Functionality

## Design
Using general Bootstrap technology, navigation, headers and responsive design have been implemented to give a comfortable experience on mobile, tablets as well as desktops.

## Run Locally
N/A - Libraries and Javascript code may be copied freely, but I would prefer that content not be distributed.

## Tech Stack
 - PHP
 - Bootstrap
