# This is my home website

## Task

Overview of workhistory, online resume and portfolio.
Also has sandboxes and subdomains for potential clients.

## Criteria

- PHP used for DRY programming for libraries, headers and footers
- Foundation for basic cosmetics
- On smaller screens, condense the menu to the "Hamburger" icon and use a transition effect when clicked (both in and out).

## Summary of Tech Stack 
This app was built on godaddy, mainly because I've had the domain and hosting setup for years with .NET functionality.  

## Functionality
Simple website

## Design
Using general Foundation (Bootstrap-like) technology, navigation, headers and responsive design have been implemented to give a comfortable experience on mobile, tablets as well as desktops.

## Run Locally
N/A - Libraries and Javascript code may be copied freely, but I would prefer that content not be distributed.

## Tech Stack
 - PHP
 - CDN
 - Foundation
 - Motion UI
 - jQuery
